# Flight-Ticket-Price-Prediction
This project aims to predict flight ticket prices using various machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about flights, including airlines, routes, prices, class categories, and other relevant features.
<br/>

# Project Structure
<br/>
The project is organized in a Jupyter Notebook (flight-ticket-price-prediction.ipynb) and includes the following main sections:
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
2. Importing necessary libraries
3. Loading the dataset
4. Basic data exploration (shape, info, describe)
5. Data Analysis
6. Checking for null values
7. Identifying numerical features
8. Outlier detection using boxplots

# Data Preprocessing

1. Handling missing values

2. Feature engineering

3. Data visualization

4. Model Building

5. Train-test split

6. Feature scaling

7. Model training (Linear Regression initially shown)

8. Model Evaluation

9. Performance metrics (MSE, R2 score)

# Dataset
<br/>
The dataset (Freshly_cleaned.csv) contains 300,257 records with 25 features, including:

1. Airline information

2. Departure and arrival locations

3. Price and class categories

4. Flight duration

5. Number of stops

6. Time-related features (day, month, departure/arrival times)

# Key Findings
1. The dataset contains no null values

2. Numerical features show some outliers that may need handling

3. Price distribution varies significantly by class (Economy vs Business)

4. Flight duration and stops appear to be important factors

# Requirements
1. Python 3.11.13

# Key libraries:

1. NumPy

2. Pandas

3. Matplotlib

4. Seaborn

5. Scikit-learn

# Usage
1. Clone the repository

2. Install required packages

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook

# Future Work
1. Explore more advanced models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

2. Feature importance analysis

3. Hyperparameter tuning

4. Deployment as a web application
